# Percentage (Math Q&A)

This folder is reserved for percentage-specific logic.

Planned examples we can support next:

- "What is 15% of 200?"
- "200 ka 15% kitna hai?"
- "Increase 500 by 12%" / "500 me 12% badhao"
- "Discount 20% on 999" / "999 par 20% discount"

Rule: keep percentage-related code here (not in `number/`).
