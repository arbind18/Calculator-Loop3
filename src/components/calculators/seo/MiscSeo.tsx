    <h2>Body Mass Index (BMI) Explained</h2>
    <p>
      BMI is a screening tool used to identify potential weight problems in adults.

    </p>
    <h3>BMI Categories (WHO)</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Underweight:</strong> Less than 18.5</li>
      <li><strong>Normal weight:</strong> 18.5 – 24.9</li>
      <li><strong>Overweight:</strong> 25 – 29.9</li>
      <li><strong>Obesity:</strong> 30 or greater</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
