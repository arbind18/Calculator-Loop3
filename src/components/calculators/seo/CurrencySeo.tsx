    <h2>Global Currency Exchange</h2>
    <p>
      In our interconnected world, currency conversion is a daily necessity for travelers, businesses, and investors.
      Exchange rates fluctuate constantly based on economic indicators, geopolitical events, and market sentiment.

    <h3>Factors Affecting Exchange Rates</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Interest Rates:</strong> Higher interest rates offer lenders in an economy a higher return relative to other countries.</li>
      <li><strong>Inflation:</strong> A country with a consistently lower inflation rate exhibits a rising currency value.</li>
      <li><strong>Political Stability:</strong> Foreign capital seeks countries with strong political and economic performance.</li>
    </ul>
