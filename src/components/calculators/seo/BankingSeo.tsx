      <li><strong>Guaranteed Returns:</strong> Interest rates are fixed at the time of opening the account.</li>
      <li><strong>Flexible Tenure:</strong> Choose a tenure ranging from 7 days to 10 years.</li>

    <h2>Simple Interest Calculation</h2>
    <p>
      Simple interest is a quick and easy method of calculating the interest charge on a loan. 
      Simple interest is determined by multiplying the daily interest rate by the principal by the number of days that elapse between payments.
    </p>
    <h3>Formula</h3>
    <p>
      $A = P(1 + rt)$ where:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>A:</strong> Total Accrued Amount (principal + interest)</li>
      <li><strong>P:</strong> Principal Amount</li>
      <li><strong>r:</strong> Rate of Interest per year (in decimal)</li>
      <li><strong>t:</strong> Time Period involved in months or years</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      This calculator is useful for short-term loans and basic investment calculations.

    <h2>The Power of Compound Interest</h2>
    <p>
      Compound interest is the addition of interest to the principal sum of a loan or deposit, or in other words, "interest on interest". 
      It is the result of reinvesting interest, rather than paying it out, so that interest in the next period is then earned on the principal sum plus previously accumulated interest.
    </p>
    <h3>Why It Matters</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Wealth Creation:</strong> Over long periods, compounding can significantly increase the value of an investment.</li>
      <li><strong>Debt Growth:</strong> Conversely, it can make debts grow rapidly if interest is not paid off.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      This calculator demonstrates how small regular investments can grow into substantial sums over time due to compounding.
