    },
    {
      question: 'How to calculate total interest paid on a loan?',
      answer: 'Total Interest = (EMI × Number of months) - Principal Amount. For example, ₹10 lakh loan at 10% for 10 years: EMI = ₹13,215, Total Interest = (₹13,215 × 120) - ₹10,00,000 = ₹5,85,800.'
    },
    {
      question: 'What is moratorium period in education loans?',

      question: 'How much should I invest monthly in SIP?',
      answer: 'Start with 10-20% of monthly income. Increase SIP by 10-15% annually (step-up SIP). ₹10,000/month for 25 years at 12% = ₹1.89 crore. ₹20,000/month = ₹3.78 crore. Start early and increase with salary hikes.'
    },
    {
      question: 'What is rupee cost averaging in SIP?',
      answer: 'You buy more units when market is down (prices low) and fewer units when market is up (prices high). This averages out your purchase cost over time, reducing impact of volatility. Example: ₹1000/month buys 10 units at ₹100, 20 units at ₹50 - average ₹66.67.'
    },
    {
      question: 'Should I stop SIP when market is high?',
      answer: 'No, continue SIP regardless of market levels. Timing the market is difficult. SIPs work best with long-term discipline. Market highs are followed by higher highs over time. Stopping SIP means missing compounding and potential future gains.'

    },
    {
      question: 'What is BMR and how does it differ from TDEE?',
      answer: 'BMR (Basal Metabolic Rate) is calories burned at complete rest. TDEE (Total Daily Energy Expenditure) = BMR × Activity Level multiplier. TDEE includes daily activities and exercise. Weight loss requires eating below TDEE, weight gain above TDEE.'
    },
    {
      question: 'How many calories should I eat to lose weight?',
      answer: 'Calculate your TDEE first. For safe weight loss: eat 300-500 calories below TDEE (lose 0.5-1 kg/month). Extreme deficits (>1000 cal) cause muscle loss and metabolism slowdown. Combine calorie deficit with protein intake and strength training.'

    },
    {
      question: 'What is the difference between weight loss and fat loss?',
      answer: 'Weight loss = loss of fat + muscle + water. Fat loss = specifically losing fat while preserving muscle. Focus on fat loss through: calorie deficit + high protein + strength training. Scale weight can mislead - use body composition and measurements.'
    },
    {
      question: 'How many calories does 1 kg of fat contain?',
      answer: '1 kg of body fat = approximately 7,700 calories. To lose 1 kg fat, create 7,700 calorie deficit over time. Safe rate: 500 cal deficit/day = 1 kg fat loss in 2 weeks. Faster loss often includes water and muscle.'
    },

      question: 'What is ideal weight for my height?',
      answer: 'Use BMI 22 (middle of healthy range) as reference. For 170cm: ideal = 22 × (1.7)² = 63.6 kg. However, consider: body composition, muscle mass, frame size. Athletes may be "overweight" by BMI but have low body fat.'
    },
    {
      question: 'Should I do cardio or weights for fat loss?',
      answer: 'Both are beneficial. Cardio burns more calories during workout. Weights build muscle, increasing BMR (muscle burns more at rest). Optimal: combine both - 3-4 strength sessions + 2-3 cardio sessions weekly. Diet is 70% of fat loss.'
    },
    {
      question: 'How to calculate body fat percentage at home?',
      answer: 'Methods: (1) US Navy Method (using neck, waist, hip measurements), (2) Skinfold calipers, (3) Bioelectrical impedance scales. Most accurate: DEXA scan. Navy method is reasonably accurate (±3-4%) and free. Take multiple measurements for consistency.'
    },
    {
      question: 'What is metabolic adaptation and how to avoid it?',
      answer: 'Prolonged calorie deficit slows metabolism (body adapts to conserve energy). Prevent by: (1) Moderate deficits (not extreme), (2) Diet breaks (eat at maintenance for 1-2 weeks every 3 months), (3) Strength training, (4) High protein intake.'

      question: 'What is the 4% withdrawal rule?',
      answer: '4% rule: Withdraw 4% of retirement corpus annually (adjusted for inflation). ₹1 crore corpus = ₹4 lakh/year or ₹33,333/month. Based on historical data, this ensures corpus lasts 30+ years. Conservative investors use 3-3.5%.'
    },
    {
      question: 'When should I start retirement planning?',
      answer: 'As early as possible - ideally in 20s. Starting at 25 vs 35 means 10 extra years of compounding. ₹10,000/month from 25-60 (35 years) at 12% = ₹6.43 crore. Starting at 35 (25 years) = ₹1.89 crore. Time is your biggest asset.'
